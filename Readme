Reality Glitch Detector
A web-based tool to detect "glitches" in reality’s mathematical codebase by comparing real-world planetary orbit data (Earth’s orbit from NASA’s JPL Horizons) against predictions from Keplerian orbital mechanics. Built as part of the MathCodebase framework, which models reality as a hierarchy of mathematical classes, this tool visualizes anomalies as potential bugs in the universe’s code, with a cryptic nod to cosmic mysteries.
Features

Interactive Chart: Line chart (Chart.js) plotting observed (NASA) vs. predicted (Keplerian) x-coordinates of Earth’s orbit (Jan 1–10, 2025).
Shadow Force Slider: Perturb predictions with a hypothetical force (0–0.01 μAU) to simulate cosmic glitches (e.g., dark energy).
Cryptic Feedback: Displays “Cosmic bug detected—new axiom needed?” if deviations exceed 0.01 AU or shadow_force is non-zero.
Applications: Research (probe new physics), industry (space mission planning), education (teach orbital mechanics), or speculative exploration (simulation glitches).

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ (for backend data generation):
Install dependencies: pip install astroquery numpy


Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (for running the HTML UI).
Internet Access: Required for Chart.js CDN and NASA JPL Horizons data (if regenerating orbit_data.json).

Setup and Running

Generate Orbital Data:
Run the Python script to fetch Earth’s orbit data from NASA’s JPL Horizons (Jan 1–10, 2025):pip install astroquery numpy
python generate_orbit_data.py


This creates orbit_data.json in the same folder.


Run the Web App:
Place reality_glitch_detector.html and orbit_data.json in the same directory (e.g., /Users/santoshkumar/Desktop/NewGlitch).
Start a local HTTP server to avoid CORS issues:cd /Users/santoshkumar/Desktop/NewGlitch
python -m http.server 8000


Open http://localhost:8000/reality_glitch_detector.html in a browser.
Alternative: Use the embedded-data version of reality_glitch_detector.html (no JSON needed):
Copy the HTML from the provided artifact.
Open directly in a browser (double-click or file://).




Interact:
Adjust the shadow_force slider to perturb the predicted orbit.
Watch the chart update and look for the cryptic “Cosmic bug detected” message.



Expected Results

Chart: Two lines:
Indigo (Observed X): Earth’s x-coordinate (AU) from NASA data (~0.983 to 1.015).
Orange-Red (Predicted X): Keplerian predictions (~0.984 to 1.014), matching closely unless perturbed.


Slider: shadow_force (0–0.01 μAU) adds a wobble to the predicted line, triggering “Cosmic bug detected—new axiom needed?” if non-zero.
Fallback: If orbit_data.json fails to load, embedded sample data ensures the chart renders.

Troubleshooting

Only Slider Visible:
Issue: fetch('orbit_data.json') fails due to CORS or file path issues.
Fix: Use the local server (python -m http.server 8000) or the embedded-data HTML version.
Check: Ensure orbit_data.json is in the same folder and matches the expected structure (see sample_orbit_data.json).


Chart Not Rendering:
Open browser console (F12, Console tab) for errors (e.g., “Failed to fetch”, Chart.js issues).
Verify internet access for Chart.js CDN.
Share errors for debugging.


JSON Issues:
If orbit_data.json is malformed, rerun generate_orbit_data.py.
Check JSON structure:{
  "times": ["2025-01-01", ...],
  "observed_x": [0.983, ...],
  "predicted_x": [0.984, ...],
  "deviations": [0.001, ...],
  "glitch_detected": false
}





Future Enhancements

Add more planets (e.g., Mercury for relativistic effects).
Include dark_energy or other cryptic parameters.
Extend to other MathCodebase systems (e.g., bacterial growth for InformationTheory).
Build a React-based dashboard for multiple systems.
